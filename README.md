# This extension is no longer supported
Why? Because it used to use Replit as a backend - the avatars have to be stored somewhere. But this means that when Replit shut down free hosting, I lost a provider. It's too much of a hassle to upkeep at the moment, and nobody really uses it anyway. I don't really foresee myself bringing it back online. If you'd like to run this yourself, you can use the files in the KAvatars-Backend folder on a Node.js server, and point the URLs in the KAvatars source code to your server. Then you can sideload the custom build.
