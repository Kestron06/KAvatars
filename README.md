# KAvatars

This will allow you to use and view custom avatars on Khan Academy!

To use this extension, download and extract the zip file here: https://github.com/SMOMusic/KAvatars/releases/tag/0.1, then you can sideload it. Will be published to the Edge add-ons store soon, however Chrome requires payment to publish to.
